## Readme for my todo application

```
  I wanted to do something a little different than a todo list. So I thought about changing it to a watching videos list on youtube.
```

- I gave the comments my instructor made on the first assignment some thought and thought that keeping my styling how it is, is how I want to leave my project. I am not sure what about the styling of the color selection of the image assests mean since I am taking the thumbnails of the video themselves rather than making new ones. By keeping the original thumbnails, the user can easily see what the video is about. I used a darker theme because most people at around my age tend to use dark themes instead of brighter ones. If this were to go online for others to use rather than just a school project, I would probably attempt to make my website look at the default theme for windows similar to other sites and apply whichever style (light or dark) depending on the system settings. 

- I'm not going to lie when I say this, I was very confused and frustrated on the first assignment. However, I skipped a few classes to gather my thoughts and take a breather (I went back to watch the recordings) and I enjoyed this section of the assignment quite a bit. I hope my "custom approach" to this project looks like I'm enjoying myself because this part of the assignment was definitely easier than the first. I think it may be because I just did a massive assignment for my intermediate app dev class that involved CRUD which is why I named some of my variables CRUD or UD (the "ud" of CRUD).
